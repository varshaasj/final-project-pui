                    The Ruby on Rails application that we built over the course of three months is a full-stack web application that serves as a scanner application to match patients to the nutrients they must consume. The application was designed to help patients track their nutritional intake and provide them with the information they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 

                    The application is built using the Ruby programming language and the Rails framework, which allowed us to quickly develop and test the application. We also used several other technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to enhance the functionality and design of the application. 
                                     
                     
                    In addition to the scanner and nutrient matching features, the application also includes a number of other features such as a dashboard that displays the user's nutritional progress over time, the ability to set and track goals, and a recipe database that provides users with healthy recipes based on their dietary needs.

                    The website for the market research firm was a collaborative effort between myself and the client. We worked closely together to ensure that the final product met their needs and reflected their brand. 
                   
                    From there, I began building the website using WordPress. I chose this platform because it allowed me to easily create a custom design that would meet the client's needs. I started with a basic theme and then customized it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    
                    
                    The final website included all of the features the client wanted, including a clean and modern design, easy navigation, a blog for sharing insights and news, and a portfolio that showcased their past work. The site was also fully responsive, meaning it looked great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
                    
                    Overall, the project took about three months to complete.

The app utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze the input melody and generate a set of harmonies that are musically coherent and pleasing to the ear. In addition to generating harmonies, the app also displays the input notes in a sheet music format, allowing users to read and play the melody themselves. With this app, users can easily create complex and beautiful harmonies for their musical compositions, without the need for extensive musical training.
